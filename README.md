<strong>Overview</strong>


For this game I used Javascript to program a timer for the page, once the game started. There are 5 questions and you have 120 seconds to guess the right answers. At the end of the game, your correct, incorrect and unanswered questions are tailed for you. So the question is, how well do you know the world? 


<strong>Languages/Technologies Used</strong>
